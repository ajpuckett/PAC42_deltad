Nucleon spin-flavor decomposition is one of the main challenges facing our field, and is one of the key physics issues that have driven the JLab-12 GeV upgrade.
%\cite{12GeV_CD0}

%This experiment is designed to address this question.


The physics goals of this experiment includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item {Provide the highest precision data set of polarized neutron ($^3$He) double-spin asymmetry $A_{1n}^h$ in several hadron production channels in semi-inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering reactions, with hadron $h=\pi^+, \pi^-, \pi^0, K^+, K^-$,  on a dense grid, over a wide range of ($x, Q^2, z$) and also cover a wide range of hadron transverse momentum $p_T^h$.}    

\item {Investigate the behavior of  $A_{1n}^h$  on its dependency of $Q^2, z$, hadron $p_T^h$ and azimuthal angle $\phi_h$. Compare with the expected behavior from Next-Leading-Order  QCD predictions, identify possible higher-twist effects }

\item { Through the method of Next-Leading-Order (NLO)  QCD global fit , obtain the best knowledge of nucleon spin-flavor decomposition.  Provide clear answers to the questions: Are sea quarks polarized ? Do sea up-quarks carry positive helicity as STAR W asymmetry data suggested ?  How much helicity  each quark flavor carry ?  }

\item { Through the method of Leading-Order ``Purity Method'' obtain 5-flavor nuclear spin decomposition,  as applied in HERMES and COMPASS data, obtain piont-to-point extraction on ratios of  $\Delta q/q$ for each quark flavor [$\Delta u/u, \Delta d/d, \Delta \bar{u}/\bar{u},  \Delta \bar{d}/\bar{d}$    and $ (\Delta s+\Delta \bar{s})/(s+\bar{s})$]. }  

\item { Through deliberate careful control of phase space and detection efficiency, obtain high precision results on the charged pion difference asymmetry, $A_{1n}^{\pi^+-\pi^-}$, a charge and flavor non-singlet observable which is only sensitive to valence quark polarization $\Delta d_v - 1/4 \Delta u_v$.  When combined with future JLab  SIDIS data on a polarized proton target,  obtain $\Delta u_v$, $\Delta d_v$ and polarized sea flavor asymmetry $\Delta \bar{u}-\Delta \bar{d}$, and their fist moments, such as $\int  [\Delta \bar{u}(x)-\Delta \bar{d}(x)] dx$. } 

\item { Through high precision SIDIS hadron multiplicity data  within the same experimental set up, on  unpolarized reference cell runs,        carry out a self-consistent simultaneous NLO fit on multiplicity and spin asymmetry to  constrain fragmentation function and parton helicity.    High precision results from this experiment will build up into a JLab-12 GeV SIDIS database for future NLO fits, which will also include data from polarized proton and deuteron targets.}
\end{itemize}

This proposal follows the footsteps of earlier JLab-6GeV spin-flavor decomposition proposals 
%\cite{semi-SANE, Hall A}
and an earlier JLab-12 GeV proposal.

Using the same high luminosity polarized $^3$He target system and two large acceptance spectrometer combination: BigBite Spectrometer as the electron arm and Super-BigBite Spectrometer (SBS) as the hadron arm,  as in the approved Transversity experiment,  this experiment will be able to collect data in the same run group as the Transversity experiment,  with a longitudinal target spin setting.  The main features of this experiment includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item {World highest luminosity polarized  target ($^3$He), with an average polarization of 65$\%$.  }
\item {Two large acceptance magnetic spectrometers, as electron-arm and hadron-arm detect SIDIS in coincidence. The best Figure-Of-Merit for neutron SIDIS spin asymmetries.}
\item{The highest $Q^2$ available for SIDIS reactions at  JLab-12 GeV,  completely complimentary to that of the  SoLID experiment in  Hall A.  At beam energies  of 11 GeV and 8.8 GeV,  provide coverage to a wide range of $Q^2$ , similar to that of CLAS12. }
 \item{Clear particle identification and reliable separation of $\pi/K$ over the entire range of hadron momentum through the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector in SBS.}
  \item{Identical detection phase space for positively-charged  and negatively-charged hadrons, and through SBS magnetic field reversal, a unique feature that is ideal to measure SIDIS yield differences of $\pi^+ -\pi^-$ and corresponding asymmetries.}  
\end{itemize}
