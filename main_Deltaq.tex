\begin{abstract}
  Precision measurements of longitudinal double-spin asymmetries
  $A_{1n}^{h}$, $h = \pi^+, \pi^-, \pi^0, K^+, K^-$ in semi-inclusive
  deep-inelastic scattering on a longitudinally polarized $^3$He
  target are proposed. These asymmetries are sensitive to the
  flavor-separated quark helicity distributions of the nucleon. The
  flavor decomposition of nucleon spin is one of the major physics
  goals of the JLab 12 GeV upgrade. The experiment will
  reach high statistical figure-of-merit using a high-luminosity
  polarized $^3$He target and the BigBite and Super BigBite
  spectrometers in Hall A, in a configuration identical to
  approved experiment E12-09-018, that will measure transverse
  single-spin asymmetries in SIDIS. Compared to existing and planned measurements on proton
  and deuteron targets, SIDIS asymmetries measured on $^3$He provide
  superior sensitivity to $\Delta d$ and $\Delta \bar{d}$. The kaon SIDIS
  asymmetries measured by this experiment will provide access to the polarized strange quark
  distribution $\Delta s$. A total of 30 days of running in Hall A are
  requested, including 20 days at 11 GeV and 10 days at 8.8 GeV. The
  proposed experiment will dramatically improve our knowledge of the
  flavor-separated quark helicity distributions in the valence region,
  and provide precision data for the next generation of NLO QCD global
  analysis of polarized PDFs.
